1. Mean
mean is the average i.e. sum of all the numbers divided by the no of numbers


2. Median
Median is the middle element of the numbers which is ordered in ascending to descending

3. Mode
mode is the frequently occurring element in the list

ex:-1) Find the mean, median, mode, and range for the following list of values:
13, 18, 13, 14, 13, 16, 14, 21, 13

Ans)

Mean :-
The mean is the usual average, so I'll add and then divide:

(13 + 18 + 13 + 14 + 13 + 16 + 14 + 21 + 13) รท 9 = 15

Median :-
The median is the middle value, so first I'll have to rewrite the list in numerical order:

13, 13, 13, 13, 14, 14, 16, 18, 21 (odd number)

There are nine numbers in the list, so the middle one will be the (9 + 1) รท 2 = 10 รท 2 = 5th number i.e. 14

. Arrange the data points from smallest to largest.
. If the number of data points is odd, the median is the middle data point in the list.
. If the number of data points is even, the median is the average of the two middle data points in the list.

Mode :-
The mode is the number that is repeated more often than any other, so 13 is the mode.

The mode is the most commonly occurring data point in a dataset. The mode is useful when there are a lot of repeated values in a dataset. There can be no mode, one mode, or multiple modes in a dataset.
