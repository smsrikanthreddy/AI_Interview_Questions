Histogram:-

To make a histogram, divide up the axis into bins (sometimes called “classes”) and make a rectangle for each bin whose height is proportional
to the number of data points in the bin. These are devilishly hard to make by hand, and they look somewhat different depending on your choice 
of bin size and position. But for large numbers of data points, they give you a clear idea about the shape of a distribution.

 A histogram looks like a bar graph except that the bars are adjacent, that is, there's no space between them.

Barplot:-

A bar chart shows the distribution of categorical data. All of our examples above were of numerical, quantitative data: the numbers have a 
place on a number line, and they have an inherent order. They are also continuous; it’s possible to be 163.47 cm tall or 34.5 years old.


Boxplot:-

A box plot is a visual picture of a distribution using the five-number summary: the minimum, the first quartile (a.k.a. Q1), the median, the 
third quartile (Q3) and the maximum. Because they are simple diagrams, students can make box plots by hand. Box plots are particularly good 
for comparing two distributions: when students see two or more box plots in parallel, they can easily see the differences between groups.
